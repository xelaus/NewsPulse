# News Pulse
## Hack Western 2

Base on the User's search News Pulse maps out related news events based on real time twitter feeds from broad range of global new sources.
In light of recent global events, we wanted to visually depict what news stories are being covered around the world and by which news stations. We felt this would give an idea as to which stories news agencies of various countries found most important to share with the public and societies in which they reported to and perhaps influenced.
